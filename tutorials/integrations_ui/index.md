#Integrate Sauce Labs and Slack with Bluemix DevOps Services

######Last modified: 29 September 2015

Time: 15 minutes 

In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy a copy of a sample application in your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; account that is managed by an IBM Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services tool chain. This tool chain is automatically pre-configured with Sauce Labs and Slack integrations. The tool chain is also pre-configured with existing DevOps Services such as Track and Plan, Git, the web integrated development environment (Web IDE), and Delivery Pipeline.

This DevOps Services tool chain integrates automated functional tests run on Sauce Labs into the DevOps Services pipeline. These tests can provide valuable flow control for your projects, acting as gates to prevent the deployment of bad code.

The tool chain also integrates Slack messaging into the DevOps Services pipeline. You can send notifications about build and deploy activities to your Slack channels. 

**Important**: This is a Beta feature. After you [deploy your app](#deploy_app), you cannot modify or remove the configured integrations from the generated project.

## Before you begin

*To do this tutorial, you need a DevOps Services account and a Bluemix account. The accounts are free and provide access to everything you need to develop, track, plan, and deploy apps. Signing up is simple: when you sign up for DevOps Services, you can also sign up for a trial of Bluemix.

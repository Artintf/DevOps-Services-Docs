#Linking work items in Bluemix DevOps Services to commits in GitHub

###### Last updated: 11 August 2015

If you have source code in a GitHub repository, you can use your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project to track changes by setting up a service hook on GitHub. When you push a change to your GitHub repo, the hook adds a change-set link to your DevOps Services work item. You can also add a work-item link to a commit on the Git Log page.

##Creating a DevOps Services project

If you already have a DevOps Services project that is connected to a GitHub repo, skip to [Set up the GitHub hook](#github_hook).
1. Sign in to [DevOps Services][1]. The My Projects page opens.
2. If this project is your first project, click **Start coding**. Otherwise, click **CREATE PROJECT**.   
3. Type the project name.
4. Click **Link to an existing repository**.   
5. If you haven't authorized with GitHub or logged in to GitHub, do so when you are prompted and then return to DevOps Services.
6. From the **Select the repository to link** list, select your GitHub repo.

7. Make sure that the **Add features for Scrum development** check box is selected.
8. Click **CREATE**.

## Setting up the GitHub hook

You need to set up your GitHub repo to create a link when the repo receives a push. To do so, you configure a service hook. The hook adds a link to a work item whenever a change is pushed to your repo and you include a work item keyword and number in the commit message. 

### Before you begin:

The IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook replaces the RationalJazzHub hook. If you configured the RationalJazzHub hook, disable it and configure the IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook instead.

### Configuring the service hook:

1. In your GitHub repo, in the right column, click **Settings**.
![GitHub settings link.][4]
2. Click **Webhooks & Services**.
![GitHub web hooks and services link.][5]
3. Click **Add service**, and from the **Available Services** list, select **IBM Bluemix DevOps Services**.
4. Type your IBM id and password.
5. Select the **Active** check box.   
 **Tip:** If you need to disable work item linking later, return to this page and clear the **Active** check box.  
![Configuration settings for the IBM Bluemix DevOps Services hook][6]

6. Click **Add service**.

You can now link work items to your commits. The next time that you commit a change, type a keyword and the work item's number in the commit comment; for example, `task 530`. When you push the change, a link to the change set is generated on the work item's **LINKS** tab. For a list of valid keywords, see ["Testing the hook"](#create_work_item).

## Testing the hook

To test your hook, create a work item and commit a change to your code.

1. On the DevOps Services project's Overview page, click **TRACK & PLAN**.
2. In the **Create a work item** field, type a summary and any work item attributes that you need.
3. Click **CREATE**.
4. Note the task number so that you can add it to your comment when you commit your change.
5. Make a change to one of the files in your GitHub repo. This example uses the DevOps Services Web IDE, but you can use any editor.
6. Add a commit comment that includes a work-item keyword and number. 
You can use these keywords for hooks:
   - `adoption item`
   - `bug`
   - `defect`
   - `epic`
   - `impediment`
   - `item`
   - `retrospective`
   - `story`
   - `task`
   - `track build item`
   - `work item`
In this example, the keyword is `task` and number is `530`.

##Adding a link after a change is pushed

If you already pushed a change and need to link it to a work item, follow these steps:
1. Open your project's Overview page.
1. Click **GIT LOG**.
1. Open the commit.
1. Click **Link Work Item**.
1. Select the work item and click **OK**.

A link to the change set is listed on the work item's **LINKS** tab. You can review the commit details by clicking the change-set link on the work item. From there, you can view the changed files by clicking the GitHub links. ![Link to view changes in GitHub.][11]

# Source control in Bluemix DevOps Services

###### Last updated: 19 August 2015

In your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project, you can use one of three source control systems: a GitHub repository, a Git repository that is hosted on IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade;, or a Jazz source control management (SCM) repository that is hosted on Bluemix. You select a source control system when you create your project. You can connect to a repo that you're using, or create a new repo when you create your project.

## GitHub
Store your source code with this popular Git hosting service and use DevOps Services to develop and deploy your application to Bluemix. If you choose this option, you must have a GitHub account and give Bluemix access to your GitHub account. When you create a project, you can either create a new GitHub repo or link to a repo that you're already using. For more details, see these topics:

* [Git source control](/docs/git)

## Git

Store your source code on a free public or private repo that is hosted on Bluemix. You control access to your repo by adding members to your DevOps Services project. If you decide to use Git, you create a Git repo that is hosted on Bluemix, or you can also host a local Git repo. To do so, create your DevOps Services project, and then force push your local repo to the new hosted repo. For more information, see these topics:

* [Git source control](/docs/git)

## Jazz SCM
Jazz SCM works well with Eclipse and IBM Rational Team Concert&trade;. For information about using Jazz SCM hosted on Bluemix, [see Setting up local Eclipse clients to work with Jazz SCM](/docs/jazz_scm_client).

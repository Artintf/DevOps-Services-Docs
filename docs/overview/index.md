# What's IBM Bluemix DevOps Services?

Last updated: 22 June 2015

IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services is software as a service (SaaS) on the cloud that supports continuous delivery. With DevOps Services, you can develop, track, plan, and deploy software in one place.

From your projects, you can access everything that you need to build all kinds of apps. You can work on your own or use the collaboration tools to work with a team. After you build an app, you can deploy it to the IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; cloud platform. In minutes, you can go from source code to a running app.

## Bluemix and DevOps Services

Bluemix is the platform where you deploy your app and add services. The Bluemix Catalog contains services for data management, mobile apps, cloud integration, web apps, and security. The DevOps services in the Catalog are Delivery Pipeline and Track & Plan. You can create a project in DevOps Services or from your Bluemix app with a click of the **ADD GIT** button.

## Development support
In DevOps Services, you can develop software for any language or buildpack. You can also add Agile planning features to your project. The Web IDE provides content assist, tooltips, previews, validation, and syntax highlighting for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Markdown files. Syntax highlighting is also supported for these file types:

In addition, DevOps Services supports deployment to Bluemix with predefined buildpacks for Java, Node.js&trade;, Go, PHP, Python, and Ruby apps.
 
If you are building a Node.js app, you can make quick updates as you develop and debug by using 
[Bluemix Live Sync](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/bluemixlive.html). 
Bluemix Live Sync works on the command line and in the Web IDE.

## Agile planning
If you're more of a planner than a code developer, you can create a project just for planning. When you create the project, be sure to add the Agile planning features.

# Integrating Sauce Labs with Bluemix DevOps Services 

###### Last updated: 21 September 2015

You can integrate autmotated functional tests that run on Sauce Labs into the IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services pipeline. When configured as a test job in a pipeline, a Sauce Labs test suite can run Java or JavaScript tests against your web or mobile application as part of your continuous delivery process. These tests can provide valuable flow control for your projects, acting as gates to prevent the deployment of bad code.

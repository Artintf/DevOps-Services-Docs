# Integrating Sauce Labs with Bluemix DevOps Services 

###### Last updated: 29 September 2015

You can integrate automated functional tests that run on Sauce Labs into the IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services pipeline. When configured as a test job in a pipeline, a Sauce Labs test suite can run Java or JavaScript tests against your web or mobile application as part of your continuous delivery process. These tests can provide valuable flow control for your projects, acting as gates to prevent the deployment of bad code.

**Important**: The Sauce Labs integration is a Beta feature. After you [enable this Beta feature](#enabling_the_beta_features), you cannot disable or modify it. To test the Sauce Labs integration in a copy of your project without changing the original version, [fork an existing DevOps Services project](#forking_a_devops_services_project). Otherwise, click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button from within a [sample](https://hub.jazz.net/project/idsorg/sample-java-cloudant/overview) to deploy sample code and create a tool chain that you can test the Sauce Labs integration in.

## Before you begin
* [Register for DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net).
* [Register for Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/). 
* [Register for a Sauce Labs account](https://saucelabs.com/) if you don't already have one. Sauce Labs offers 14-day trials for new accounts. If you want to learn how to use Sauce Labs, [see the official Sauce Labs documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/). 
* Ensure that you have at least one existing DevOps Services project with a pipeline set up that you can use to deploy your app. Otherwise, you can click the **Deploy to Bluemix** button from within a [sample](https://hub.jazz.net/project/idsorg/sample-java-cloudant/overview) to deploy sample code and create a tool chain that does not already integrate with Sauce Labs.

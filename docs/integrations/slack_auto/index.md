## Before you begin
* [Register for DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net). 
* [Register for Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/). 
* [Register for a Slack account](https://slack.com/) if you don't already have one.

The Slack integration is a Beta feature. You can fork an existing DevOps Services project to test the Slack integration in a copy of your project without changing the original version.

1. [Log in to DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net). The My Projects page opens.

2. Click **EXPLORE**, find the project to start from, and click its name.

3. Click **FORK PROJECT**. When you fork a project, the original project's source is copied into a new DevOps Services project that you own.

4. In the Fork Project window that opens, type your project name, review the contents of the window, and specify options as needed. For more information about the options, [see Starting a Bluemix DevOps Services project](#starting_a_devops_services_project).
 
5. Click **CREATE**.
